          Aaron Rodgers finished the game face down on the turf after sailing a
          lateral out of bounds on a frantic, failed final play. <br /><br />
          This is not exactly what the four-time NFL MVP envisioned when he
          returned for another season in Green Bay. <br />br Rodgers and the
          offense sputtered, penalties piled up at the most inopportune moments
          and the Packers lost their third game in a row, 23-21 to the
          Washington Commanders on Sunday for their longest skid since 2018.
          <br /><br />
          SCORE: <br /><br />

        <h2>Milwaukee Bucks</h2>

          />In their home opener, the Milwaukee Bucks left the Houston Rockets
          on the launching pad from tip-off, never trailing on their way to a
          convincing 125-105 victory. After a somewhat deferential opener in
          Philly, Giannis poured in 44 points on just 21 shots in a mere 28
          minutes. <br /><br />
          It became clear pretty early that the Baby Rockets could do very
          little against Giannis and Co., with the Bucks starting off on a 16-2
          run, including the first 13 points unanswered. Milwaukee led 41-23
          after one, shooting 65.2% and hitting 7 of their first 10 triples.
          Powered by Jalen Green, the Rockets briefly shrank the lead to as
          close as 13, but Giannis put together a 7-1 personal run to win the
          quarter by one, and give his team a 67-48 advantage at the half.
          <br /><br />
          Houston torched the nets from outside in the third, drawing as close
          as 12 by hitting 6 of their 11 three-point attempts. Still, Giannis
          was simply too much for even the most scorching perimeter shooting,
          pouring in 18 third-quarter points to keep the Rockets at bay, nearly
          notching 40 in three quarters. Once again, the Bucks managed to even
          things out and reestablish their 19-point lead, heading into the
          fourth up 98-79. Giannis exited with 8:08 remaining and up 22, though
          Bud waited almost six more minutes before emptying his bench, allowing
          for MarJon Beauchampâ€™s NBA debut, followed by his first NBA bucket.
          Those would be the final Milwaukee points as they finished off Houston
          125-105 to move to 2-0 on the young season.
